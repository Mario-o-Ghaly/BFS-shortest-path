# BFS-shortest-path
## Overview
A code for getting the shortest path between 2 nodes in an undirected-unweighted graph using breadth-first search(BFS) algorithm.

## User Guide
There are 2 graph images in the repository that you can try the code on if you enter **E**. You will only need to enter the source node and destination node.

Otherwise, you can build the graph yourself. You will need to enter **M** first, you will be guided to enter the edges then, and finally you will enter the source and destination nodes required to find the shortest path between.
